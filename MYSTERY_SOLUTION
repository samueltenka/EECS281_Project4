PROBLEM: nonoptimal OPTTSP solutions
solution: we need MST to work for any given distance function.
...not yet solved?!

PROBLEM: OPTTSP sometimes finds no solutions at all, resulting in infinite expected cost!

PROBLEM: OPTTSP is fuckn slow
solution: use fasttsp to get first bound!
...?

PROBLEM: OPTTSP segfaults
...is this to do with inputs too large? what data structures do we create?
...ok it was a problem in our MST partial_prim: since we marked some pts as 'visited',
i.e. as not to be included in mst, we shoulda skipped over them when calculating mst cost.
