PROBLEM: nonoptimal OPTTSP solutions
solution: we need MST to work for any given distance function.
...not yet solved?!

PROBLEM: OPTTSP sometimes finds no solutions at all, resulting in infinite expected cost!

PROBLEM: OPTTSP is fuckn slow
solution: use fasttsp to get first bound!
...?

PROBLEM: OPTTSP segfaults
...is this to do with inputs too large? what data structures do we create?
